This repository contains all the files for my graduate's thesis(?) at LABFIN.PROVAR-FIA, Graduate Program in Finance Engineering.

My research is about _Machine Learning Asset Allocation_. Hierarchical Risk-Parity, PCA-Eigen and RNN-LSTM models are examples of algorigthms that I work. 
The goal is provide options to traditional asset allocation methods for brazilian investors.
